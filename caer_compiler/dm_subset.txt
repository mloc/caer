missing error for assignemnt in expr position without surrounding ()

no goto
    mostly unused in modern ss13
    allows jumping back out of spawn "closures" - hard to implement, espc. with llvm coros
    jump to label is weird, WEIRD

no icon procs or client << browse_rsc
    for now. protocol doesn't support icons
    might hack in enough to get nano/tg ui working

spacemandmm limitations
    no ..... / ......

lists are limited to 2^24-1 elements
